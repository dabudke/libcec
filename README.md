# libcec - StreetPass for All

`libcec` is designed to be an abstraction against the raw system calls needed to
work with StreetPass on the Nintendo 3DS using homebrew. A minimum of like 30
lines of repetitive code is needed each time you want to access the data for a
game.

## Requirements

Needed is the 3DS development toolchain from devkitPro, `libctru`, and
an expansion of it aptly named `libctru-cecd` for working with the CECD service

## Documentation

The code is documented inline, and I plan on having doxxygen or something
later down the line.
